	What did you come here for?
	What did you expect to find?
	Is there something hidden here?
	Is there something in this rhyme?

	Something pleasant in the sunshine,
	something smooth against my toes,
	another thing, when striding,
	is sure of where it goes.

	There's no one out, but no one home;
	there's no one living in the well.
	But when the bat moves on the swing,
	it rings like it's a bell.

	Fortune wants to judge the living,
	while history tells the dead.
	You may seek the DNS vault
	but the link you follow's red.
